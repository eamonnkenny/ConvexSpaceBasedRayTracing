Input Data Creators (capacity.txt)
----------------------------------

capacitygrid  - creates 3 areas of large to low signal strength for optimisation simulations
capacitygrid2 - creates 5 areas of large to low signal strength for optimisation simulations


Optimisation Simulation runners
-------------------------------
optimise - runs all the necessary steps to run the simulation and to produce all associated plots


Dependency programs
-------------------

cellsize - called by the bestserver*.m files to obtain the capacity files
